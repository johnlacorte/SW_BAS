Hello all, about twenty years ago I came across this text game set in the Star
Wars universe written in BASIC in the 1990s. I could never find a newer version
and I could never find anything else from the programmer. After a couple years,
I couldn't find it anywhere on the internet so it's possible my copies of the
files are the last in existence.

A few times I thought about trying to find Christian Baumgartner (Baumi) and
letting him know how much I enjoyed the game and how it was always among the
first things I thought of when it came time to backup my files and how much
I enjoyed the challenge of trying to make sense of the thousand or so lines
of spaghetti code with comments, variables, and labels that were in German.

The game cannot be compiled as is by any compiler I know of due to it being
like, 30 individual programs that use a temporary file to communicate between
them. Every event has code to test or modify the global state in some way so
rewriting this game the right way in another programming language may end up
being significantly larger than the original. It probably explains why BASIC
was put on every early personal computer with limited memory even though
programming in it is so terrible. I believe BASIC programs were sometimes more
compact saved to its bytecode format than the same program written in assembly
language.

This game ran fine for me using qbasic on Windows versions that still included
DOS but haven't been able to get it to run under DOSBox. There may come a day
where a complete rewrite will be the only thing to keep this alive and that
will be the end of it.

What do I like about this game? There's three branches of the story even though
there's only two endings. You can ally yourself with the rebels, the Empire,
or work as a bounty hunter. The bounty hunter part just ends and you have to
go back and work your way up one of the other branches unfortunately. It uses
the rules of West End Games' Star Wars table top RPG and I love the D6 system.
There was a time when a writer would receive the full collection of West End
Games' Star Wars source books as a reference when they write a novel set in the
Star Wars universe. There was a lot of imagination that went into this. In the
code I see hints of what it could have been if it hadn't hit a complexity limit
or he no longer had the time to spend on this or whatever it was that stopped
it's developement.

I'm going to leave it here and write up notes of the things I've learned
looking through the code and maybe turn it into something that's playable again
someday. It might just be there waiting for the day that I get the inspiration
to write my great Star Wars story.
