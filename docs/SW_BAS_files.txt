The .SW files were the original files that I downloaded. They were last
modified between May 10th, 1996 and June 29, 1996. It looks as if there may
have been some distribution of earlier versions because there's an error
message about loading an old version of the save file and a save file conversion
program "CONVERT.BAS".

On December 19-20, 2001, I made copies of all the files, changed the extensions
of the files to .BAS and changed them in the source of all the files so I
could run the game with qbasic. It looks like I was up until 1:22am doing that
and then played it for another 2 hours and thirty-eight minutes before going to
sleep.

A.BAS, B.BAS, C.BAS, D.BAS, E.BAS, F.BAS, G.BAS - Save files slot A-G, from the
    games I was played. Some of these might have been edited from the form
    generated by the game. Probably when I was up way later than I should've
    been.

A.SW, B.SW, C.SW - Save files that came with when I downloaded this.
    Games played by Baumi (The name of the original programmer I think),
    R.J. Withers, and Uncle Sam.

ADV.SW / ADV.BAS - Run when a character levels up.

AS.SW / AS.BAS - Credits.

CC.SW / CC.BAS - Cloud City on Bespin.

COFL.SW / COFL.BAS - An event on the ISD Invincible, a star destroyer.

CONVERT.BAT - Batch file to run the save file converter.

CONVERT.BAS - Converter for the older save files. "If your computer locks up
    then the slot is too old to convert..."

CSS.SW / CSS.BAS - Calamari space station.

FIGHT.SW / FIGHT.BAS - This handles all the fighting parts of the game.
    When this is run, a string (combat$) is used to select the correct
    battle to fight. It's probably the complicated part. There's a lot
    of duplication, in places it uses more simplified methods than in the Star
    Wars Second Edition rules from West End Games. The stats are a little
    different too. You could revert to the full rules of the SWRPG but you
    would probably have to do some work tweaking the difficulty.

GP.SW / GP.BAS - Glibba's Palace on Ord Mantell.

HOTHMAP.SW / HOTHMAP.BAS - Outside areas of Hoth.
